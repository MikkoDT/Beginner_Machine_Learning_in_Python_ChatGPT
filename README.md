Level 1 - REGRESSION
Linear Regression:

Overview

* A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features).
* Aims to find a linear equation that best fits the observed data.
* Used for prediction, analysis of relationships, and assessing the impact of variables.
  
Key Concepts

Dependent Variable (y): The variable to be predicted.
Independent Variables (x): The variables used to predict the dependent variable.
Linear Equation: y = β0 + β1x + ε
β0: Intercept (value of y when x = 0)
β1: Slope (change in y per unit change in x)
ε: Error term (accounting for unobserved factors)
Training Data: Data used to fit the model and estimate the coefficients (β0 and β1).
Types

Simple Linear Regression: One independent variable.
Multiple Linear Regression: Multiple independent variables.
Assumptions

Linearity: Relationship between variables is linear.
Independence: Errors are uncorrelated with each other.
Normality: Errors are normally distributed.
Homoscedasticity: Variance of errors is constant.
Evaluation

R-squared: Proportion of variance in y explained by the model.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared errors.
Residuals: Differences between observed and predicted values.
Applications

Prediction: Forecasting future values of the dependent variable.
Feature Importance: Identifying the most influential variables.
Hypothesis Testing: Assessing relationships between variables.
Implementation

Various libraries and tools in Python, R, and other languages.
Popular implementations: Scikit-learn, statsmodels, R's lm() function.
