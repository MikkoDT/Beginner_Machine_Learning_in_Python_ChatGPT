Level 1 - REGRESSION
Linear Regression:

Overview

* A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features).
* Aims to find a linear equation that best fits the observed data.
* Used for prediction, analysis of relationships, and assessing the impact of variables.
  
Key Concepts

* Dependent Variable (y): The variable to be predicted.
* Independent Variables (x): The variables used to predict the dependent variable.
* Linear Equation: y = β0 + β1x + ε
       - β0: Intercept (value of y when x = 0)
       - β1: Slope (change in y per unit change in x)
       - ε: Error term (accounting for unobserved factors)
* Training Data: Data used to fit the model and estimate the coefficients  
  (β0 and β1).
  
Types

* Simple Linear Regression: One independent variable.
* Multiple Linear Regression: Multiple independent variables.

Assumptions

* Linearity: Relationship between variables is linear.
* Independence: Errors are uncorrelated with each other.
* Normality: Errors are normally distributed.
* Homoscedasticity: Variance of errors is constant.
  
Evaluation

* R-squared: Proportion of variance in y explained by the model.
* Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared errors.
* Residuals: Differences between observed and predicted values.

Applications

* Prediction: Forecasting future values of the dependent variable.
* Feature Importance: Identifying the most influential variables.
* Hypothesis Testing: Assessing relationships between variables.

Implementation

* Various libraries and tools in Python, R, and other languages.
* Popular implementations: Scikit-learn, statsmodels, R's lm() function.

Level 2 - CLASSIFICATION
Logistic Regression:

Overview

* A statistical method for classification tasks, predicting the probability of a categorical outcome (usually binary).
* Maps input features to a probability between 0 and 1 using a sigmoid function (S-shaped curve).
* Employs a linear decision boundary to separate classes.

Key Concepts

* Sigmoid Function: σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z)), maps real-valued numbers to probabilities.
* Decision Boundary: A line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that separates classes.
* Logistic Model: P(y = 1 | x) = σ(β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ... + βpxp), where:
   - P(y = 1 | x): Probability of class 1 given input features x.
   - β0: Intercept.
   - βp: Coefficients for each feature xp.

Training

* Goal: Find optimal model parameters (β0, β1, ..., βp) that best fit the training data.
* Algorithm: Uses optimization techniques like gradient descent to minimize a cost function (often cross-entropy loss).

Evaluation

* Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.
* Precision: Ratio of true positives to predicted positives.
* Recall: Ratio of true positives to actual positives.
* F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
* ROC Curve: Visualizes model performance across different thresholds.
* AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve): A summary measure of model performance.

Applications

* Spam Detection: Identifying spam emails.
* Fraud Detection: Detecting fraudulent transactions.
* Customer Churn Prediction: Predicting customer attrition.
* Medical Diagnosis: Predicting disease risk.
* Image Classification: Recognizing objects in images.

Implementation

* Available in most machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
